I am a member of the Computer Vision and Mixed Reality Group [(CVMR)](https://cvmr.info) and the [LAVIS](https://lavis.cs.hs-rm.de/) Group at the Department of Design, Computer Science and Media at RheinMain University of Applied Sciences. During my doctoral studies, I researched virtual worlds and their integration into augmented reality, exploring different artificial intelligence methods to advance this field.

My primary research interests lie in physics-based simulations, computer graphics, computer vision, and artificial intelligence. I am also interested in the application of generative AI and natural language processing.

Teaching is an important and rewarding aspect of my work. I have experience conveying mathematical and physical concepts to diverse audiences and teaching a wide range of computer science topics. I enjoy supervising student projects and am always open to inquiries from students interested in developing creative solutions under my guidance.

Currently, I am active at the interface between the university and [hessian.AI](https://hessian.ai), the center for AI of the state of Hesse. I provide technology-driven consulting on the application of artificial intelligence. I support the conception of AI projects and actively promote the transfer of research into practice. In this role, I maintain a broad network of contacts with professionals in the AI community and industry partners.
